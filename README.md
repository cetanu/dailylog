# üóìÔ∏è dailylog

A minimal journaling tool

## ‚ú® Features

- Opens your `$EDITOR` (defaults to `vim`) to write an entry
- **Git commit style parsing**: First line becomes title, body after blank line
- Saves entries with timestamps and markdown formatting to `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- View previous day's log entry with `dailylog previous`
- **Log summarization**: Review and analyze logs for the past X days with statistics
- **Git sync support**: Sync logs across devices with automatic push/pull
- Configurable log directory via a simple TOML config
- Clean, dependency-light, and terminal-native

## üì¶ Installation

Requires Rust toolchain. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cetanu/dailylog.git
cd dailylog
cargo build --release
cp target/release/dailylog ~/.local/bin/
```

### Install via Cargo

```bash
cargo install dailylog
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a config file at `~/.dailylog.toml`:

```toml
# Directory where your daily logs are stored
log_dir = "/path/to/your/log/folder"

# Optional: Git repository URL for syncing logs across devices
git_repo = "https://github.com/yourusername/dailylogs.git"

# Optional: Enable automatic git sync after each log entry (default: false)
git_auto_sync = true

# Optional: Days to include in summary statistics (default: monday-friday)
# Accepts: monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday
# Short forms also work: mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun
summary_days = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"]
```

Make sure the log directory exists, or `dailylog` will try to create it on first run.

## Usage

### Create a new log entry

```bash
dailylog
```

This will:
1. Open your editor (via `$EDITOR` or default to `vim`)
2. Parse your input using git commit style (title on first line, body after blank line)
3. Save formatted entry with timestamp to a file like `2025-05-31.md`
4. Auto-sync with git if enabled

**Entry format example:**
```
Fixed authentication bug

Updated the login system to handle edge cases.
This resolves the timeout issues users reported.

- Improved error messages
- Added validation
```

**Becomes:**
```
## 14:30 - Fixed authentication bug

Updated the login system to handle edge cases.
This resolves the timeout issues users reported.

- Improved error messages
- Added validation
```

### View previous day's log entry

```bash
dailylog previous
```

### Add to previous day's log

```bash
dailylog yesterday
```

### Edit today's log in-place

```bash
dailylog edit
```

This opens today's log file in your editor, allowing you to modify, add to, or reorganize your entries for the day.

### Summarize and review logs for past X days

```bash
# Summarize logs for the past 7 days (default)
dailylog summary

# Summarize logs for the past 30 days
dailylog summary --days 30

# Short form
dailylog summary -d 14
```

This command provides:
- **Summary statistics**: Total entries, logging consistency percentage, by
    default includes only Monday-Friday, but can be customized via `summary_days`
    in config
- **Daily breakdown**: Shows entry titles/headers for each day with entries
- **Colorized output**: Easy-to-read format with different colors for different sections

### Git sync commands

```bash
# Sync logs (pull then push)
dailylog sync

# Pull latest logs from repository
dailylog pull

# Push local logs to repository
dailylog push
```

**Setting up git sync:**
1. Create a git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Add `git_repo = "your-repo-url"` to `~/.dailylog.toml`
3. Run `dailylog sync` to initialize
4. Optionally enable `git_auto_sync = true` for automatic syncing

Note: on shells like `fish`, sometimes `$EDITOR` is not set to propagate to child processes. You can fix this with `set -Ux EDITOR myEditor`
